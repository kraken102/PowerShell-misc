PowerShell Scripts â€“ CTF & Daily Use

This repo is a personal collection of PowerShell scripts I use for Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and general day-to-day tasks.

âš¡ Note: Everything here is a work-in-progress. Expect rough edges, half-built ideas, and the occasional script that works only on Tuesdays after coffee.

Goals

Speed up common tasks during CTFs (enumeration, automation, quick exploits).

Simplify everyday workflows where PowerShell can save clicks/keystrokes.

Keep experimenting and learning along the way.

Status

ðŸ›  Still under active tinkering.

ðŸ“¦ Scripts may break, get rewritten, or vanish completely without warning.

ðŸ”’ Primarily for personal use, but feel free to adapt/modify if they help you.

Usage

Clone/download the repo.

Review scripts before running (always a good habit).

Use at your own risk.
